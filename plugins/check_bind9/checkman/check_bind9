 This check checks for ISC Bind9 basic health.
 You need to install the plugin {dns} into the {plugins} directory of your agent.
 Before install the plugin, you must edit and the query_log variable to reflect the
 query_log file path of named.conf.

 If you want "queries persecond" information, you must configure your named.conf like this:

 channel "query_log" {
   file "/var/log/query.log" versions 10 size 100m;
   severity info;
   print-time yes;
 };
 category queries { "query_log"; };

 And change the "agent/plugin/isc_bind9" to reflect the "query_log" file location.
